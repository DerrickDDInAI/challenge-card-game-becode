# challenge-card-game-becode
This a card game.

The main branch of the repository has **Must-have features**: features to build the basis of a card game
No actual game is played in the must-have version; no points is counted. 
The program only performs the following:
- Creates a deck of cards,
- Splits it evenly between different players,
- Each turn, all players plays a card until no cards are left.

The nice-to-have branch of the repository has **Nice-to-have features**: features to build an interactive game with rules and points
The nice-to-have branch will be updated very soon.
